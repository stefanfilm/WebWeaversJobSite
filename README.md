## Description
Our motivation to create this project was to make a to create a job posting site where users can search for posts and recruiters can post job postings. We built this project to create a streamlined way to add, remove, and update job postings and to create opportuinties for job seekers. This site solves the problem of not having a website for job seekers to see current jobs that are available to them and to be able to apply to them. We learned how to build a full stack application by using node, PostgreSQL, api routes, middlewares, handlebars, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
